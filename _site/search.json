      "contents": "\r\nA bit about me\r\nI’m from Cape Town, one of the world’s sunnier places, and I have a\r\nPhD in pharmacology (my thesis was on the population pharmacokinetics of\r\nrifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, key drugs in the treatment of\r\ntuberculosis) from the University of\r\nCape Town - I also collected a BSc in microbiology and biochemistry,\r\nand an MSc in the pharmacoeconomics of malaria while I was there (as you\r\ndo).\r\nSince then, I’ve moved around a bit. I joined Uppsala University as a postdoctoral\r\nresearcher in 2004, where I had the good fortune to work in the storied\r\nDepartment of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, one of the world’s foremost\r\ncenters of pharmacometrics, and then to Switzerland in 2006, to join Novartis.\r\nIn 2010, I joined Exprimo, a pharmacometrics consulting company of\r\nsome renown. Sadly, it was acquired by a multinational logistics company\r\nsoon after, which ran it into the ground. Everyone left, and today, it\r\nno longer exists. On the bright side, this catastrophe gave some\r\ncolleagues and I the push we needed to set up shop for ourselves, and in\r\n2015, we formed Occams. My family\r\nand I moved to Germany in 2019, where we remain today.\r\nI’m a pharmacometrics consultant in my day job. I build\r\npharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and PK-PD models for drugs,\r\nbased on clinical trial data; these models can be used to explain and\r\npredict changes in drug concentration over time, given a specific dose,\r\nand how those concentrations relate to the drug’s effects (both positive\r\nand negative). I’ve worked on drugs in infectious diseases, oncology,\r\ndiabetes, and respiratory disease, amongst others - you can find a more\r\ndetailed record of what I’ve been up to here.\r\nI try to keep active in the greater pharmacometrics community. I was\r\nelected to the Board of Directors of the International Society of Pharmacometrics\r\n(ISoP) in 2016, and served as its President in 2019. My term ended\r\nat the end of 2021, and I’m pretty proud of what my ISoP colleagues and\r\nI managed to achieve while there. I’m currently part of the logistics\r\nteam at PAGE, sit on its\r\nStudent Sponsorship committee, and have been on its Scientific\r\nOrganizing Committee since 2013. I was the Novartis representative on\r\nthe DDMoRe project, served\r\nbriefly as its Scientific Director, and co-led the team that developed\r\nthe Thoughtflow\r\nconcept. The success of DDMoRe is up for debate, but I’m firmly of the\r\nopinion that did some useful things (if only more people agreed).\r\nAs well as being a full-time pharmacometrics consultant in my day\r\njob, I dabble occasionally in tool development and I’m a big fan of\r\nreproducibility in research. Census was my attempt at\r\na run management tool for NONMEM, but it has fallen into disuse over the\r\npast few years (moral of the story - if you want to build a community\r\naround an open source tool, don’t develop it in Object Pascal). I helped\r\nport xpose4\r\nfrom S-PLUS to R while at Uppsala, I maintain the pmxTools package for R,\r\nand I’m on the nlmixr\r\ndevelopment team (everyone should use nlmixr, it’s great).\r\nI’m on GitHub. On social\r\nmedia, I can be found on Twitter and LinkedIn (where I\r\nmostly just lurk).\r\nThis blog occasionally pops up at RWeekly.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\nSome history\r\nNumetric GmbH was formed in Switzerland in 2015 by Justin Wilkins\r\nafter he left SGS Exprimo. This first iteration of Numetric was a\r\nfounder member of the Occams\r\ncooperative, and together with Occams BV (run by Rik Schoemaker and\r\nbased in The Netherlands), Wade Solutions (run by Janet Wade in Sweden)\r\nand Winkmetrix GmbH (run by Julia Winkler and based in Germany),\r\nprovided pharmacometric data analysis services to the pharmaceuticals\r\nindustry under the Occams banner.\r\nIn 2019, Dr Wilkins and his family moved to Germany, and Numetric\r\nGmbH (Switzerland) was liquidated. The current version of Numetric GmbH\r\nwas started at the same time as a German company, and replaced the Swiss\r\nversion as a member of Occams.\r\n(Complicated, I know, but migrating the original version of the company\r\nacross an EU border turned out to be even more so.)\r\nOverview and contact details\r\nNumetric GmbH has two employees.\r\n \r\n \r\nJustin Wilkins, PhD\r\nOwner and CEO\r\nDr. rer. nat.
